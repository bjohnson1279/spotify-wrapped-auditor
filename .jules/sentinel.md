## 2025-01-20 - Prototype Pollution in Dictionary Aggregation
**Vulnerability:** The aggregator used `{}` (Object literal) to construct a dictionary using user-controlled data (JSON from Spotify exports). A user could craft a track artist name as `__proto__`, which modifies `Object.prototype`, causing a prototype pollution vulnerability.
**Learning:** Initializing dictionaries with `{}` when using unsanitized user input as keys exposes the application to Prototype Pollution.
**Prevention:** Use `Object.create(null)` for simple dictionary maps when relying on arbitrary string keys (or use `Map` structures), which avoids inheriting the native `Object.prototype`.

## 2025-01-20 - Hardcoded PII / IP Addresses
**Vulnerability:** `src/filters.ts` hardcoded a user's IP address (`76.149.238.152`) directly in the source code as a boolean flag `isIPv4`. This constitutes a PII leak and is hardcoded data.
**Learning:** Hardcoding sensitive configuration constants like Home IPs into source code risks exposing user identities, especially when open-sourcing or sharing the project.
**Prevention:** Externalize sensitive information to environment variables (e.g., `process.env.HOME_IP`).
